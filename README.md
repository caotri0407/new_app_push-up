# PERSONAL ACTION ANALYSIS FOR HUMANS PLAY SPORTS BY PUSH-UP APP
Based on the data we observed and looked at, the proportion of people who were obese, had type 2 diabetes and had a high risk of death.
Along with the bad effects of Covid-19 in the past time. We decided to conduct this project to analyze and develop human behavior and 
activities in order to improve exercise ability, increase resistance and most importantly, reduce injury and muscle damage for those 
who are injured beginners in sports The project is implemented on a small scale and the dataset is not yet intuitive but our desire is
to help those starting out later to understand the importance of human action and contribute to the development of the data set is still extremely scarce.

## GUI_OF_APP
My application is deployed through two forms, video analysis through each "frame" and live action via webcam.

### DATASET and MODEL
Download pretrained models at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SHuN5DJgEalW3lgJzRJs-yUP62KvKXAN) and replace the existed models file in /models.

You can also use our self-built Datasets more than 3600 images through 15% internet and 85% capture by smartphone and grow them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eKqKVRE_oCc-d0IE9Rc5kfJNIhZ8QXAa)
#### RUN_APP
The first, you must install some framework to deploy it in file /new_gui at [requirements.txt](https://github.com/caotri0407/new_app_push-up/files/9166251/requirements.txt)
 after that  Run demo app by: start_app.py 

##### NOTE:
We are in the process of completing play_button and pause_button. You can also deloy it on your project.
